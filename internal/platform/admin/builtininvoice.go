// builtininvoice.go serves the built-in-invoice surface (/api/v1/admin/built-in-invoice). Both
// endpoints are READS gated on ADMIN_BILL_READ:
//
//	GET /built-in-invoice/{id}          → list by gateway id (id == invoiceGatewayId)
//	GET /built-in-invoice/download/{id} → load by id or 404 → download the invoice PDF
//
// Neither is registered in handler.go (Grep'd), so both are added here. The integrator wires
// h.routeBuiltInInvoice(r) into Routes().
//
// The list read filters the `builtInInvoice` collection by invoiceGatewayId, newest first,
// wrapped in the list envelope.
// Empty under greenfield → {data:[],paging}; the raw BuiltInInvoice domain (carrying the nested
// BillingProfile + CreateInvoiceDetails) is passed through via shapeDoc (_id→id, drop _class). A
// populated doc's full raw shape (nested money / dates) is the same deferred concern as
// the other admin raw-domain lists — fails loud if populated, billing-list precedent.
//
// The download read loads by id (404 "Invoice %s not found" — interpolated, NO trailing space) then
// resolves the invoice integration provider and fetches the rendered PDF bytes from the external
// invoice vendor. That external fetch is an external integration point (no live vendor call this pass);
// the load-or-404 state check is faithful, then the endpoint returns 501.
