# Savings Plans

Savings plans swap commitment for a discount: a customer promises a minimum monthly spend over a fixed term and, in return, gets a percentage off. You define the plans and their discount tiers; customers — or you, acting for them — sign contracts against those plans.

## How the model behaves

- The customer commits to a monthly amount (say 500/month) for the plan's term.
- Usage the plan covers is discounted at the tier rate that matches the committed amount.
- Spend **over** the commitment is charged at ordinary price-plan rates.
- Spend **under** the commitment doesn't lower the charge — the committed minimum is owed regardless. That's the deal.
- Contracts paid **upfront** (the whole term in advance) can earn deeper discounts than pay-as-you-go ("no upfront") contracts.

## Defining a plan

Go to **System → Savings plans** and create one.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Name | Customer-visible, e.g. `Compute savings`. |
| Target resources | Which resource types (with optional filters) the discount covers — scope a plan to compute, storage, or any subset; multiple targets are allowed. |
| Duration (months) | The contract term for this schedule, e.g. `12` or `24`. |
| Discount tiers | Rows of *committed amount from* → *discount %*. |
| Tiers apply to upfront-paid contracts | Whether this tier set is the **upfront** or the **no-upfront** schedule for that duration. |

Tiers climb with commitment — a bigger committed amount reaches a higher tier and earns a larger discount:

```
Duration: 12 months, no upfront
  ≥ 100 / month   →  5 %
  ≥ 500 / month   → 10 %
  ≥ 1000 / month  → 15 %

Duration: 12 months, paid upfront
  ≥ 100 / month   →  8 %
  ≥ 500 / month   → 14 %
  ≥ 1000 / month  → 20 %
```

A single plan can hold several schedules (12-month, 24-month, and so on), each with its own tier sets. The plan list summarizes them, e.g. `12 mo: up to 10%`.

## Contracts

A contract binds a billing profile to a plan. From the same page you can create one for a customer:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Billing profile | The customer entering the commitment. |
| Plan / Duration | Must be one of the plan's defined schedules. |
| Committed / month | The monthly commitment — this sets the tier and therefore the discount rate. |
| Paid upfront | Selects the upfront tier set (and payment model). |
| Start | `CURRENT_MONTH` or `NEXT_MONTH`. |

Active contracts are listed alongside their committed amounts, so you can see who's on which plan.

## Expiry reminders

So a contract's end doesn't take customers by surprise, enable **Savings contract expiry notifications** under **System → Billing configuration → Settings**. Enter the reminder offsets as comma-separated days before expiry, e.g. `30, 14, 7` — the customer receives an email at each checkpoint. Renewal means a new contract; expired contracts do not renew on their own.
