# Automatic Suspension

Automatic suspension is your defense against customers who keep consuming resources without paying. Stratos watches each billing profile, fires off escalating warnings as the account slides, and finally suspends it — pausing the account's cloud resources — once the configured threshold is crossed.

## Turning it on and picking a trigger

Open **System → Billing configuration**, go to the **Settings** tab, and enable **Automatic suspension**. Exactly one trigger type is active at a time:

| Type | Watches | Thresholds are expressed in |
|---|---|---|
| `BALANCE` | The account balance. | The **Balance** fields (typically zero or negative amounts). |
| `DUE_DATE` | Unpaid invoices. | The **Days** fields (days past the invoice due date). |

## Warnings and the cut-off

Two things are set in the same section:

- **Notification limits** — a list of checkpoints. When the balance drops to a listed value (or an invoice ages past a listed day count), the customer gets a warning email. Add as many as you like with **Add limit**.
- **Suspend at** — the final threshold (**Suspend at — balance** or **Suspend at — days**, depending on the trigger type) at which the profile is actually suspended.

A sample balance policy:

```
Type: BALANCE
  Notify at:     0        "your balance is exhausted"
  Notify at:   -10        "top up now to avoid suspension"
  Suspend at:  -20        account suspended
```

A sample due-date policy:

```
Type: DUE_DATE
  Notify at:   3, 5, 7 days after the invoice due date
  Suspend at:  10 days     account suspended
```

## What a suspension does

Suspending a billing profile suspends its projects: running servers are paused and the OpenStack project is disabled, so the customer can neither use nor create resources. The data itself is kept — suspension is reversible, not destructive. Suspended profiles show their status under **Client area → Billing profiles**.

## Bringing an account back

Once the customer settles up — tops up the balance or pays the overdue invoice — resume the profile from its page under **Client area → Billing profiles**. Its projects are re-enabled and any paused servers are unpaused. Chronic non-payers can be terminated by hand from that same page once your own grace policy has run its course.
