# Teammates and Invitations

Projects are meant to be shared. Anyone with the right permissions can invite a colleague by email; the colleague follows a link, accepts inside the portal, and is a project member from that moment on. All of this happens under **Organization → Members**.

## Inviting by email

1. Open **Organization → Members**.
2. In the invite area, type the teammate's **email address**.
3. Click **Send invite**. Stratos mails them a personal invitation link.

If the person is already part of your organization, skip the email round-trip: use **Add member** to attach an existing organization member straight to the current project. Pick the member, assign a role, and click **Add to project**.

## Accepting an invitation

The invitation email carries a deep link into the portal (`/join-project?invite-token=…`). When the recipient opens it:

1. They sign in — or register first if they don't yet have an account. Registration uses the exact email the invite went to.
2. The portal presents the invitation with the project's name and two buttons: **Accept invite** or **Decline**.
3. Accepting makes them a member and drops them straight into the project. Declining throws the invitation away.

## Roles and permissions

Every project member has a role, shown and editable through **Set role** on the Members page:

| Role | Typical rights |
|------|----------------|
| OWNER | Full control: the project, its members, and its resources |
| ADMIN | Manage resources and everyday settings |
| MEMBER | Work with the project's cloud resources |

New invitees arrive as a regular member. That lets them create and manage cloud resources, but **not** rename or delete the project, invite anyone else, or remove members — those stay with owners and admins. If your operator has enabled custom roles, you'll find them under **Organization → Roles**.

## Removing members

Owners and admins can remove someone from the project whenever needed, via **Remove from project** on the Members page. Removal cuts off project access at once; it does not delete the person's account or touch their membership in other projects.

Every membership change — invites sent, invites accepted, members removed, roles changed — is written to **Organization → Audit log**.
